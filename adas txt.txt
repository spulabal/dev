I have 2.2 yrs experience in automotive testing, have hands on experience with both Parking assistance and Climate control projects, 
coming to parking assistance project parking assistance is front 4  and rear 4 channel redar sensor system to indicate object distance to the driver while parking it will support and  indicte 30cm to 3 meter range distance 
Tested this feature functional requirements with all possible conditions like ,power distribution, ignition cycle,  park assist switch command, gear, vehicle speed, park assistance status, distance indication for each sensor tested all conditions with boundary, equivalent,  range transmissions in this project worked with CAN, UDS service's, Functional requirements and Fault modules 
Coming to the functional behavior this system  have range like standby mode, Active mode, deactivate mode, Fault mode, when the pre conditions meet this system will be in active mode like set all can signals from canoe 
Case 1:
I/p
1) set Power ??status signal = 'ON' and 
2) set Ignition signal = ACC or ON or Crank (more then acc) 
3) Set park assist switch command = ON
4) Set Gear = Drive or Reverse
5) set vechile speed = 0km to 12km + or - 1km
O/p
1) check park assist system status = active
2) check distance indication 
Front left sensor(1) = No object
Front middle sensor(2&3) = No object
Front right sensor(4) = No objectobject

Rear left sensor(1) = No object
Rear middle sensor(2&3) = No object
Rear right sensor(4) = No objectobject

3) check 
front park assist jone status = green?? zone
Rear park assist jone status = green?? zone

Case 2:
 I/p
1) set Power ??status signal = 'ON' and 
2) set Ignition signal = ACC or ON or Crank (more than acc) 
3) Set park assist switch command = ON
4) Set Gear = Drive or Reverse
5) set vechile speed = 0km to 12km + or - 1km
6) set 
Front left sensor(1) = 30cm
Front middle sensor(2&3) = 30cm
Front right sensor(4) = 30cm

Rear left sensor(1) = 0 CM
Rear middle sensor(2&3) = 0 CM
Rear right sensor(4) = 0 CM

O/p
1) check park assist system status = active
2) check distance indication 
Front left sensor(1) = 30cm
Front middle sensor(2&3) = 30cm
Front right sensor(4) = 30cm

Rear left sensor(1) = No object
Rear middle sensor(2&3) = No object
Rear right sensor(4) = No objectobject

3) check 
front park assist jone status = Red ?? zone
Rear park assist jone status = green?? zone

and used canoe tool for test this signal with bench setup and also used Doors,  Qm,  CCM

Coming to the fault modules

Have different fault like 
Can communication faults LOC & Invalid & Bus off
Loc fault (loss of communication) & invalid fault 
Like if disabled Gear periodical can message the particular DTC will log and if
set gear signal = invalid 
Short CAN high to low for bus off fault
 
faults for all sensors

Short circuit faults
Short to ground 
Short to battery??
Open circuit

Voltage ?? faults
Over voltage
Under voltage

Load faults
Over load 
Under load
